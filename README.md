Title: Orbital structure of the effective pairing interaction in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates

Authors: Peizhi Mai, Giovanni Balduzzi, Steven Johnston, Thomas A. Maier

Abstract: The nature of the effective interaction responsible for pairing in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates remains unsettled. 
This question has been studied extensively using the simplified single-band Hubbard model, which does not explicitly consider the orbital degrees 
of freedom of the relevant CuO2 planes. Here, we use a dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo approximation to study the orbital structure of the 
pairing interaction in the three-band Hubbard model, which treats the orbital degrees of freedom explicitly. We find that the interaction 
predominately acts between neighboring copper orbitals, but with significant additional weight appearing on the surrounding bonding molecular 
oxygen orbitals. By explicitly comparing these results to those from the simpler single-band Hubbard model, our study provides strong support 
for the single-band framework for describing superconductivity in the cuprates.
